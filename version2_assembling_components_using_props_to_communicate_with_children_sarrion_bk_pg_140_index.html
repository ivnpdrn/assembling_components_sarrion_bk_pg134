<!-- This is a comment -->


<!-- the included counters.js file describe the "counters" component -->
<!-- These new concepts will explain how a parent component communicates with its child components (thanks to attributes, called props)-->
<!-- and how a child component commmunicates with its parents component (thanks to events and the $emit() method). -->
<!-- These two concepts make it possible to assemble the components between them by allowing them to communicate between a child component and a parent component --> 

<!-- Summary:-->
<!-- attributes: props: parent component ==> child component -->
<!-- events & method: $emit() method(): child component ==> parent component --> 

<!--communication in the reverse direction, from parent to child, is done through attributes called props.-->
<!--for this, we use the nb attribute in the component. For example, we will write <counters nb="5" /> to display 5 counters on the page-->  -->
